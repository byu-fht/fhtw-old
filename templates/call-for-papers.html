## Scope of the Workshop

The 2016 Family History Technology Workshop will bring together
developers, researchers, technology professionals, and users to
discuss the future of family history technology and genealogical
research. The workshop will feature developer sessions, lightning
talks, technical presentations, panels, and demos to showcase emerging
and future technologies.

## Lightning Talk: What's Your Problem?

This session will be oriented toward users helping developers and researchers
understand the problems they are facing.  
  
Give a 2 to 5 minute presentation on a family history problem that you think technology
can solve. What is your problem? Who does this problem affect?  What impact
would solving this problem have on family history? Do you have an idea for
how technology could fix this? 

To submit an idea for a lightning talk, send us a one paragraph
description of what you will cover. Include a short biographical
statement explaining your background with family history.
  
## Lightning Talk: What's Your Tech?

This session will be oriented toward developers showcasing the
latest work they have done.

Give a 2 to 5 minute presentation on your latest work in family
history technology. We welcome startups, new open source projects,
work-in-progress, or strongly-held (but informative) opinions on where
the future of family history technology will go.

To submit an idea for a lightning talk, send us a one paragraph
description of what you will cover. Include a short biographical
statement and a link to your product or web site and to your social
media profile. Indicate whether you would also like to provide a demo
in between sessions.

## Developer Talk

Give a 10 to 15 minute talk about new tools, libraries, or languages,
accompanied by a demo of what is being developed. Our emphasis is on
novel approaches that will impact the future of family history
technology.

To submit an idea for a developer talk, send us a 1 - 2 paragraph
description of what you will cover. Include a short biographical
statement and a link to your developer profile on GitHub or other
relevant sites.

## Research Talk

Give a 10 to 15 minute presentation on your research, including key
ideas, algorithms and results. Topics could include data modeling,
extraction, search, natural language processing, document processing,
handwriting recognition, machine learning, expert systems, social
networks, human interfaces, data visualization, mobile technologies,
automated research, cloud computing, security, or other areas of
computing as they relate to family history research. Working demos are
strongly encouraged.

To submit an idea for a research talk, send a 1 - 2 page extended
abstract, including citations, similar to what you would submit to a
technical conference in your field of study. Include a short
biographical statement and a link to your personal web presence and/or
social media profile.

## How to Submit

Presenters should submit the above information by January 15, 2016 to
fhtw@internet.byu.edu. Submissions will be reviewed by members of the
