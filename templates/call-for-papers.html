## Scope of the Workshop

The 2017 Family History Technology Workshop will bring together
developers, researchers, technology professionals, and users to
discuss current and emerging family history technologies. The workshop
will feature developer sessions, lightning talks, technical
presentations and demos to showcase technologies that will impact the
future of Family History and Genealogical Research.

## Developer Talk

You are invited to give a 10-15 minute talk about new tools,
libraries, or languages, accompanied by a demo of what is being
developed. Our emphasis is on novel approaches that will impact the
future of family history technology.

To submit an idea for a developer talk, send us a 1-2 paragraph
description of what you will cover. Include a short biographical
statement and a link to your developer profile on GitHub or other
relevant sites.

## Lightning Talk

You are invited to give a 2-5 minute presentation on your latest work
in family history technology. We welcome startups, new open source
projects, work-in-progress, or strongly-held (but informative)
opinions on what technology break-throughs are most needed and how
this will impact the future of family history.

To submit an idea for a lightning talk, send us a one-paragraph
description of what you will cover. Include a short biographical
statement and a link to your product or web site and to your social
media profile. Indicate whether you would also like to provide a demo
in between sessions.

## Research Talk

You are invited to give a 10-15 minute presentation on your research,
including key ideas, algorithms and results. Topics could include big
data, deep learning, data modeling, extraction, search, natural
language processing, document processing, handwriting recognition,
machine learning, expert systems, social networks, human interfaces,
data visualization, mobile technologies, automated research, cloud
computing, security, or other areas of computing as they relate to
family history research. Research with demonstrated results will be
given priority. Working demos are strongly encouraged.

To submit an idea for a research talk, send a 1-2 page extended
abstract, including citations, similar to what you would submit to a
technical conference in your field of study. Include a short
biographical statement and a link to your personal web presence and/or
social media profile.

## How to Submit

Presenters should submit the above information by January 16, 2017 to
fhtw@internet.byu.edu. Submissions will be reviewed by members of the
